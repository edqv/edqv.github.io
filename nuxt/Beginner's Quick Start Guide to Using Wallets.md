## Creating and Backing Up Your Wallet  

### **Step 1: Download and Install**  
Choose a reputable wallet provider (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Ledger) and follow their installation instructions.  

### **Step 2: Generate a Mnemonic Phrase**  
During setup, your wallet will generate a **12- or 24-word mnemonic phrase**. This phrase acts as a recovery tool if you lose access to your wallet. **Never share it online or store it digitally.**  

### **Step 3: Set a Strong Password**  
Create a unique password combining letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid reusing passwords from other accounts.  

### **Step 4: Backup Your Wallet**  
Most wallets offer a backup feature to save your mnemonic phrase. Store physical copies in secure locations (e.g., a safe) or use encrypted digital backups.  

**FAQ**: *What if I lose my mnemonic phrase?*  
Unfortunately, losing your phrase means permanent loss of access to your funds. Always treat it like a physical key to a vault.
