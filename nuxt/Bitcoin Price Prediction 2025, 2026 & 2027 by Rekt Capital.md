|------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bull Market Peak | 2021  | Record institutional adoption, retail frenzy, ETF approvals                         |

## 2026 â€” The Bitcoin Bear Market

While 2025 promises explosive growth, Rekt Capital warns that 2026 will likely enter bear market territory. Historical parallels suggest:

- **Price Corrections**: Potential 60â€“70% retracements from peak levels
- **Market Sentiment**: Heightened fear and panic selling among retail investors
- **Opportunity Zone**: Strategic accumulation for long-term holders during capitulation phases

Smart investors should prepare by:
1. Securing profits from 2025 gains
2. Allocating capital for discounted BTC purchases
3. Diversifying into stable assets during volatility peaks

### FAQ: Navigating Market Phases

**Q: When should I consider re-entering the market after a bear phase?**  
A: Look for "three white soldiers" candlestick patterns and volume surgesâ€”historically reliable bottoming signals.

**Q: How does Bitcoin's halving event influence these cycles?**  
A: The 2024 halving reduced supply issuance by 50%, creating structural scarcity that typically drives 18â€“24 months of price discovery.

## 2027 â€” The Bottoming-Out Phase

By 2027, the bear market's worst effects should subside. Key developments to watch:
- **Institutional Positioning**: Major banks launching Bitcoin ETFs post-regulatory clarity
- **Technological Adoption**: Lightning Network scaling solutions enabling microtransactions
- **Geopolitical Factors**: Increased BTC adoption in emerging markets facing currency instability

This phase offers a critical entry point for investors who missed the 2025 rally. Historical data shows bottoming phases often create multi-year holding opportunities with 10x+ potential.
