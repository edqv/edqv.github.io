## Key Features of the Injected Providers API

### Wallet Connection Capabilities
The API offers multiple methods for establishing secure wallet connections, with version-specific availability ensuring compatibility across different user environments:

1. **connect()**: Establishes basic wallet connection, returning user address and public key
2. **requestAccounts()**: For versions 2.77.1+, requests account access
3. **getAccounts()**: Retrieves current account address (2.77.1+)

These methods form the foundation for user authentication and account management within DApps, enabling developers to implement secure onboarding flows while maintaining compatibility with various wallet versions.

### Network and Balance Information
Critical for application functionality is the ability to retrieve network status and account balances:

- **getNetwork()**: Identifies current network (2.77.1+)
- **getPublicKey()**: Accesses account public key (2.77.1+)
- **getBalance()**: Provides BTC balance details including confirmed/unconfirmed amounts (6.51.0+ app versions and 2.77.1+ extensions)

This information enables developers to implement network-specific logic and provide users with accurate account status updates.

### Transaction Management
The API offers comprehensive transaction handling capabilities:

| Transaction Type | Method | Key Features |
|------------------|--------|--------------|
| Standard BTC Transfers | sendBitcoin() | Fee rate customization |
| Memo-enabled Transfers | send() | OP_RETURN memo support |
| NFT Transfers | sendInscription() / transferNft() | Protocol-specific handling (Ordinals/Atomicals) |
| PSBT Operations | signPsbt() / pushPsbt() | Batch signing and partial transaction handling |

These methods support both simple value transfers and complex smart contract interactions, with protocol-specific parameters for handling different NFT standards.

## Advanced Bitcoin Functionality

### Inscription and NFT Management
For developers working with BRC-20 tokens and other inscription-based assets, the API provides specialized tools:

- **getInscriptions()**: Retrieves list of inscriptions with pagination (6.51.0+)
- **inscribe()**: Creates transferable BRC-20 tokens
- **mint()**: Supports batch inscription operations with multiple content types

The mint() method particularly stands out with its support for various inscription types:

| Inscription Type | Content Type | Use Case |
|------------------|--------------|----------|
| BRC-20 Deploy | text/plain | Token deployment |
| BRC-20 Mint | text/plain | Token minting |
| Image Inscription | image/* | NFT media creation |
| Plain Text | text/plain | Message inscription |

### PSBT Handling and Signature Operations
The API's PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction) capabilities provide granular control over transaction signing:

- **signPsbt()**: Handles single transaction signing with customizable options
- **signPsbts()**: Batch signing for multiple transactions (6.51.0+)
- **pushPsbt()**: Submits signed PSBTs to the network (6.51.0+)
- **sendPsbt()**: Supports batch on-chain transactions with enhanced metadata

These features enable developers to implement advanced transaction workflows while maintaining compatibility with different wallet versions.

### Event Handling and Account Management
Real-time account monitoring is supported through event listeners:

- **accountChanged**: Triggers when users switch accounts (6.51.0+)
- **accountsChanged**: Notifies when exposed account addresses change (2.77.1+)

These events allow applications to maintain synchronized states and provide seamless user experiences during account switching operations.

## Implementation Best Practices

### Version Compatibility Considerations
Developers should implement version checks to ensure feature availability:

```javascript
// Example version check implementation
if (extensionVersion >= "2.77.1") {
  // Enable advanced features
} else {
  // Fallback to basic functionality
}
```

This approach ensures backward compatibility while allowing access to new features for users with updated wallets.

### Error Handling and User Feedback
Implementing comprehensive error handling is crucial for maintaining good user experience:

```javascript
try {
  const result = await okxwallet.bitcoin.sendBitcoin(toAddress, amount);
  console.log('Transaction successful:', result);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Transaction failed:', error.message);
  // Display user-friendly error message
}
```

Proper error handling helps users understand transaction outcomes while maintaining application stability.

### Security Considerations
When implementing the API, developers should follow security best practices:

1. Always validate user inputs before initiating transactions
2. Implement rate limiting for sensitive operations
3. Use secure storage for sensitive data
4. Handle private key operations through the wallet's secure environment

## Use Cases and Implementation Examples

### Decentralized Exchange Integration
A DEX can leverage the API for seamless Bitcoin trading:

```javascript
// Place order function
async function placeOrder(amount, price) {
  const signature = await okxwallet.bitcoin.signMessage(
    `Buy ${amount} BTC at ${price}`
  );
  // Submit order with signature to exchange
}

// Trade execution
async function executeTrade(orderId) {
  const txHash = await okxwallet.bitcoin.sendBitcoin(
    buyerAddress, 
    orderAmount,
    { feeRate: currentFeeRate }
  );
  // Record transaction hash against order
}
```

This implementation demonstrates how the API can facilitate secure trading operations while maintaining user control over private keys.

### NFT Marketplace Implementation
For a BRC-20 token marketplace:

```javascript
// Minting new tokens
async function mintToken(tokenData) {
  const result = await okxwallet.bitcoin.mint({
    type: 60, // BRC-20 deploy
    from: creatorAddress,
    inscriptions: [{
      contentType: "text/plain",
      body: JSON.stringify(tokenData)
    }]
  });
  return result.revealTxs[0]; // Return token ID
}

// Transferring tokens
async function transferToken(tokenId, recipient) {
  return await okxwallet.bitcoin.transferNft({
    from: senderAddress,
    to: recipient,
    data: [`${tokenId}:Ordinals`]
  });
}
```

This implementation showcases batch operations and protocol-specific handling required for NFT marketplaces.

### Wallet Integration Patterns
Implementing secure wallet integration:

```javascript
// Connection management
async function connectWallet() {
  try {
    const accounts = await okxwallet.bitcoin.requestAccounts();
    currentUser = accounts[0];
    setupEventListeners();
    return currentUser;
  } catch (error) {
    handleConnectionError(error);
    return null;
  }
}

// Event listener setup
function setupEventListeners() {
  okxwallet.bitcoin.on('accountsChanged', (accounts) => {
    updateUI(accounts[0]);
  });
  
  okxwallet.bitcoin.on('networkChanged', (network) => {
    switchNetwork(network);
  });
}
```

This pattern demonstrates proper connection handling and real-time updates for connected wallets.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I handle version-specific features in my application?
Implement version checks to enable/disable features based on wallet capabilities. Use try/catch blocks to gracefully handle unsupported methods and provide fallback options for older versions.

### What's the difference between sendInscription and transferNft methods?
The sendInscription method handles individual inscription transfers, while transferNft supports batch transfers of multiple NFTs. transferNft is particularly useful for marketplaces requiring bulk operations.

### How do I handle PSBT transactions with multiple inputs?
Use the signPsbt method with the toSignInputs parameter specifying which inputs to sign. For batch operations, signPsbts allows signing multiple transactions simultaneously.

### What content types are supported for minting inscriptions?
The API supports text/plain for BRC-20 tokens, image/* MIME types for image inscriptions, and custom content types for specialized applications. Image data must be converted to hexadecimal strings.

### How are transaction fees calculated?
Transaction fees can be controlled using the feeRate parameter in relevant methods. The feeRate represents the network fee rate in satoshis per byte, allowing developers to prioritize transaction speed vs. cost.

### What event listeners are available for real-time updates?
The API provides accountChanged and accountsChanged events for monitoring wallet state changes. These events help maintain application state synchronization when users switch accounts or modify permissions.
