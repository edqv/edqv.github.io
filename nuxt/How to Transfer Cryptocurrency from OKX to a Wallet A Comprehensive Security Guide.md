## Crypto Asset Security: Exchange vs Wallet Storage

### Advantages of Wallet Storage
| Security Feature          | Exchange Storage      | Wallet Storage          |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Private Key Control       | Exchange-managed      | User-controlled         |
| Hacking Risk              | Centralized targets   | Decentralized security  |
| Transaction Privacy       | Limited anonymity     | Enhanced privacy        |
| Recovery Options          | Customer support      | Self-responsibility     |

Hardware and cold wallets offer superior protection by storing private keys offline. Software wallets provide convenient access while maintaining user control.

### Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- **Private Key Management**: Store recovery phrases in fireproof safes or security deposit boxes
- **Phishing Protection**: Enable biometric authentication and hardware security modules
- **Transaction Verification**: Always confirm addresses using multiple communication channels
