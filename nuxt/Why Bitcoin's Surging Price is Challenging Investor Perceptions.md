# Why Bitcoin's Surging Price is Challenging Investor Perceptions  

## The Bitcoin Price Surge: A Meteoric Rise  

In 2025, Bitcoin has demonstrated unprecedented volatility and growth. Starting at approximately $8,000 (56,000 CNY) at the beginning of the year, Bitcoin broke the $10,000 barrier early on, followed by successive milestones surpassing $20,000 and eventually reaching over $144,000 (1 million CNY) in December. On December 7, Bitcoin prices globally surged past $144,000, setting a new historical benchmark. By December 11, Bitfinex platform data showed a remarkable 8% surge within five minutes, jumping from $14,468 to $15,647.  

This staggering growth has left investors questioning conventional financial wisdom. Analysts attribute this surge to multiple factors, including institutional adoption, macroeconomic uncertainties, and the introduction of Bitcoin futures on major exchanges.

These exchanges facilitate USD and fiat-crypto trading pairs, enabling global access to Bitcoin markets.
