Each Doodles NFT features a whimsical character, ranging from humans and cats to aliens and sentient flames, with varying traits that determine their rarity. Unlike some projects, Doodles does not publish official rarity rankings, but third-party platforms like Rarity Sniper provide unofficial insights.
