## Understanding MetaMask and Fantom Compatibility  

Designed initially for the Ethereum blockchain, **MetaMask** has evolved into a versatile crypto wallet capable of connecting to multiple blockchain networks, including **Fantom**. This flexibility allows users to store and manage a wide range of digital assets, from traditional tokens to **NFTs**. Fantomâ€™s compatibility with Ethereumâ€™s **smart contracts** and **EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)** makes it an attractive choice for developers and users seeking faster transactions and lower fees.  

With a **total value locked (TVL)** of $68.4 million, Fantom has established itself as a key player in the **DeFi** ecosystem. Its **Proof of Stake (PoS)** consensus mechanism and EVM compatibility enable seamless integration with Ethereum-based tools like MetaMask. This guide will walk you through the steps to add Fantom to your MetaMask wallet and start using **FTM tokens**.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Adding Fantom to MetaMask  

### 1. Install MetaMask on Your Browser  

Before connecting to Fantom, ensure MetaMask is installed on your browser. Supported browsers include **Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Brave, and Edge**. Download the extension, create a new wallet, or import an existing one. During setup, choose a strong password and securely store your **recovery phrase**â€”this is crucial for recovering your wallet if you lose access.  

### 2. Navigate to Network Settings  

Once MetaMask is installed:  
1. Click the network dropdown menu (default is Ethereum Mainnet).  
2. Select **"Add Network"**.  
3. Search for **Fantom Opera** in the preloaded networks. If itâ€™s not listed, manually enter the following details:  

| Field              | Value                     |  
|--------------------|---------------------------|  
| Network Name       | Fantom                    |

| Chain ID           | 250                       |  
| Currency Symbol    | FTM                       |  
| Block Explorer URL | https://ftmscan.com/      |  

### 3. Connect to Fantom

- Avoid sharing wallet addresses publicly.
