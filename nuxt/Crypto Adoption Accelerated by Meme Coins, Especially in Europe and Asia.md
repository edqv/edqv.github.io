The MiCA implementation, set to fully launch by late 2025, provides standardized legal structures for asset classifications, consumer protections, and service provider obligations. This regulatory clarity appears to be re-engaging retail investors post-2022-2023 market downturns.

## Political Influences on Crypto Perception

- 21% of UK and 19% of Singapore respondents reported similar shifts  

## From Viral Tokens to Financial Integration
