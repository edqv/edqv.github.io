## Tesla's Bitcoin Journey

In February 2021, Tesla made headlines by allocating $1.5 billion to Bitcoin purchases, simultaneously announcing vehicle purchases would accept BTC payments.

| Dec 2022   | BTC holdings valued at $500M   | -67% (vs peak)   |

Despite these fluctuations, Tesla maintains approximately 10,000 BTC, demonstrating strategic long-term positioning in digital assets.
